# Programming for Data Analysis Assignment 2018

The following assignment concerns the numpy.random package in Python. I am required to create a Jupyter notebook explaining the use of the package, including detailed explanation of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package. There are four distinct tasks which must be carried out in the Jupyter notebook:

* Explain the overall purpose of the package
* Explain the use of the "Simple Random Data" and "Permutations" functions
* Explain the use and purpose of at least five "Distributions" functions
* Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers
